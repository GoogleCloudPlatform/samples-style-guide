## Applicable Samples

This style guide is intended to apply to new samples and significant revisions 
to previous samples. It is not a mandate to make sure previously authored 
samples are always in compliance as the sample guide changes and evolves. 

For "standalone" samples, the guidelines are intended to be enforced more
strictly and exceptions should be rare and with good reason, up to the
disgression of the language reviewer(s).

For "application" samples, the guidelines should apply more loosely, following
the rules in as many places as possible without comprising the integrity of the
application. 

## Review Comments

Feedback on samples PRs should reference the style guide wherever possible. 
Leave a short description of what's need to comply with the style guide, and
then link to the relevant guideline.
