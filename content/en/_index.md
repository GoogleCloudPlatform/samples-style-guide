## Introduction {#introduction}

This document defines samples standards for the code samples of Google Cloud.

It encourages recommended practices for authoring code intended to teach others.
By consistently applying these practices, the collection of samples as a whole
becomes more approachable.

All samples should make best-efforts to achieve the following goals wherever
possible:

* **Copy-paste-runnable** - Users should be able to copy, paste, and run the
code in their environment with as few changes as possible. Samples should be
as easy as possible for a user to run.

* **Teach through code** - Samples should teach users both how and _why_
specific best practices should be implemented and performed when interacting
with our services.

* **Idiomatic** - Samples should encourage idiomatic and best practices specific
to language, framework, or service.

### Principles {#principles}

These principles apply in descending order of priority:

1. **Clarity**: The code's purpose and rationale is clear to the reader
2. **Idiomaticity**: The code should be written using idiomatic,
   community-driven coding practices
3. **Consistency**: The code has the same implementation from
   language-to-language
4. **Simplicity**: The code accomplishes its goal in the simplest way possible
5. **Portability**: The code should be able to run locally or in the Cloud
6. **Maintainability**: The code is written such that it can be easily
   maintained

{{% alert title="Considering idiomatic code vs. consistent samples across languages" %}}
Code samples should use preferred code patterns that are idiomatic to the
particular language (e.g., promises, futures, static API calls from singletons,
builders). This may result in samples that are radically different
from language-to-language. Err on the side of what is idiomatic to the language,
though cross-language consistency does not hurt. Generally, do things
"the way the community does it."
{{% /alert %}}

### Sample Categories

There are two categories of samples covered in this guide:

* **âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets:** A snippet is a standalone slice of code that demonstrates
  a specific Cloud operation.
* **ðŸ§© Patterns:** A pattern demonstrates a use case through multiple slices of
  code, such as a sample application. Individual slices should follow
  [snippet structure guidelines](#structure) where it improves code clarity.

## Metadata {#metadata}

### Region tags {#region-tags}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Region tags define a slice of code as a snippet and which parts of the code are
displayed from the documentation.

#### Each region identifier

* Be globally unique
* Be consistent across the same snippets in different languages
* Begin with the product's region tag prefix
* Use snake case (`snake_case`)

#### When to use region tags

* **âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets:** Region tags should contain as much of the sample as possible, so that a user can
easily copy and paste the sample into their own environment to run it.
* **ðŸ§© Patterns:** Region tags should contain those slices of code that are shown in documentation.

#### Changing region tags

Region tags and the scope of code they contain are a documentation dependency.

## Snippet Structure {#structure}

### Imports {#imports}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Samples should include any import statements that the code depends on.

This is easiest to enforce/detect when the samples are in their own file. See
the [one sample per file](#one-per-file) guideline.

### One snippet per file {#one-per-file}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

A single file should only include one snippet. This keeps the end-to-end
code relevant to the reader's current learning need.

For languages that have import statements, this shows the minimal
set of dependencies via import statements and helps reviewers validate the
[imports](#imports) guideline.

### Snippet description {#description}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Each code snippet file should have a top-level comment that succinctly describes
what the snippet does, including any setup (such as resources) required to make
the sample work:

{{< tabpane langEqualsHeader=true >}}
{{< tab header="Java" >}}

### Minimal arguments {#minimal-arguments}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Arguments should be limited to requirements for testing. In some cases, this
is project-specific information (`projectID`) or the path to an external file (`filePath`).

Do not use arguments for values that can be hard-coded, such as the type of a
file or an operation to perform.

{{< tabpane langEqualsHeader=true >}}
{{< tab header="Java" >}}
// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
public static void exampleSnippet(String projectId, String filePath) {
    // Snippet content ...
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Go" >}}
// exampleSnippet demonstrates best practices.
func exampleSnippet(projectID, filePath string) error {
    // Snippet content ...
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Python" >}}
# This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
def example_snippet(project_id: str, file_path: str) -> None:
    # Snippet content ...
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Node.js" >}}
function main() {
  // This argument is required, and should be declared
  const requiredArg = '...';

  exampleSnippet(requiredArg)
}

const exampleSnippet = function(requiredArg) {
  // Snippet content ...
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="C#" >}}
// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
public void Example(
    string projectId = "my-project-id,
    string filePath = "path/to/image.png")
{
    // Snippet content ...
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Ruby" >}}
##
# This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
#
# If any arguments are needed, document them using YARD format
# (https://yardoc.org) as illustrated below.
#
# @param project_id [String] The project ID (e.g. "my-project-id")
# @param file_path [String] Full path to input file (e.g. "/tmp/my-input.txt")
#
def example_snippet project_id:, file_path:
  # Snippet content ...
end
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="PHP" >}}
// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
function example_snippet(string $projectId, string $filePath): void
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Terraform" >}}
/*  These are example snippets for showing best practices.
*
* Don't include the 'project' argument in resources. Rely on
* the 'GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT' environment variable as documented at
* https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/basic-commands.
*
* Some resources, such as `project_iam_*`, cannot infer the project ID.
* As a workaround, use the `data "google_project"` data source.
* In the following configuration, the `google_project.project` data source
* automatically looks up the project ID of the local project.
*
* Creates an IAM policy

      expression  = "resource.name == 'projects/${data.google_project.project.id}/instances/${google_sql_database_instance.default.name}'"
      ...
    }
  }
}

resource "google_project_iam_policy" "project" {
  project     = data.google_project.project.id

}

### Process the result {#result}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Methods should avoid a return type whenever possible. Instead, show the user how
to interact with a returned object programmatically by printing example
attributes to the console. Tests should use the output of the function to ensure
that it works.

{{< tabpane langEqualsHeader=true >}}
{{< tab header="Java" >}}
// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
public static void exampleSnippet(String projectId, StringfilePath) {
    // Snippet content ...
}

{{< tab header="Go" >}}
// exampleSnippet demonstrates best practices.
// The function prints to an io.Writer for testing purposes. Do not print to
// stdout or stderr. Use the io.Writer instead.
func exampleSnippet(w io.Writer, projectID, filePath string) error {
    // Snippet content ...
    // Using the io.Writer looks like this:
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "The answer is %v\n", 42)
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Python" >}}
# This is an example snippet for showing best practices.

  // Snippet content ...
  // (This snippet should not `return` anything.)
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Ruby" >}}
def example_snippet project_id:, file_path:

  response = client.example_action example_action_request
  puts "Got the following response #{response.details}"
end
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="C#" >}}
// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.

{{< tab header="PHP" >}}
// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
function example_snippet(string $projectId, string $filePath): void
{
    // Snippet content ...
    printf(
        'Response values: %s, %s',
        $response->getExampleName(),
        $response->getExampleValue()
    );
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Terraform" >}}
# Output statement provide values that are generated after creating
# a resource. To keep it simple, they must be defined inline at the end of
# a  sample, not in a separate `outputs.tf` file.

output "domain_name_servers" {

### Arrange, Act, Assert {#pattern}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Most samples should follow the "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern as closely as
possible. Composing samples into these discrete steps makes them more
approachable to beginners:

1. **Arrange** - Create and configure the components for the request. Avoid
 nesting these components beyond 2-3 levels, it makes understanding the code
 more difficult.
2. **Act** - Send the request to the service and receive a response.
3. **Assert** - Verify that the call was successful and that the expected
 response was returned. This is typically done by [printing some of the
 response to stdout](#result).

{{< tabpane langEqualsHeader=true >}}

### No CLIs {#no-cli}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Do not include CLIs for running your sample. We expect developers
to copy and paste code directly from cloud.google.com into their
own environment.

Previous practice shows that CLIs are expensive to maintain and detract
from the purpose of the snippet.

## Code {#code}

### Language compatibility {#lang-compat}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Use features that work in all Google Cloud-supported versions of a 
language. Use language idioms that the community understands.

### Useful comments {#comments}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Comments should be used as needed with the following guidelines:

* Comments should add context not otherwise obvious from the code.
* Comments should be readable and grammatically correct.
* For values that the user may wish to configure, provide links to
  documentation that lists available options (and when to use them).

### Authentication {#authentication}

Samples should always authenticate using [Application Default Credentials][ADC].
Most clients do this automatically, and no special steps are required.

If the code snippet is platform specific, explicitly show how to use that
platform's credentials.

### Initializing Clients {#clients}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Code snippets should show users how to initialize (and clean up, if necessary)
clients used by the user. Additionally, clients should contain a comment
clarifying proper usage (such as if clients should be reused for multiple
requests or if they are thread-safe).

{{< tabpane langEqualsHeader=true >}}
{{< tab header="Java" >}}
// Initialize client that will be used to send requests. This client only needs to be created
// once, and can be reused for multiple requests. After completing all of your requests, call
// the "close" method on the client to safely clean up any remaining background resources,
// or use "try-with-close" statement to do this automatically.
try (CloudClient dlp = CloudClient.create()) {
  // make a request with the client
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Go" >}}
// Initialize a client once and reuse it to send multiple requests. Clients
// are safe to use across goroutines. When the client is no longer needed,
// call the Close method to cleanup its resources.

c, err := foo.NewClient(ctx)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "failed to initialize foo.Client: %v", err)
    return err
}
defer c.Close()

### Cyclomatic Complexity {#complexity}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Cyclomatic complexity is the measure of possible code paths. The more code
paths, the more complex the code snippet, and the harder to understand and test.
Flow control statements like conditionals (if/else), switches, and loops are
examples of code that increases cyclomatic complexity.

Code snippets should have a single path demonstrating their purpose with no
extra code.

Patterns should minimize cyclomatic complexity in implementing
[clear and simple](#principles) code.

### Error Handling {#errors}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Samples should include examples and details of how to catch and handle common
errors that are the result of improper interactions between the client and service.

If there is no solution (or if the solution is too verbose to resolve in a
sample) it is acceptable to either log or leave a comment explaining what the
developer should do.

{{< tabpane langEqualsHeader=true >}}
{{< tab header="Java" >}}
// Always catch the most specific type of Exception, instead of a more general one.
try {
  // Do something
} catch (IllegalArgumentException ok) {
  // IllegalArgumentException's are thrown when an invalid argument has been passed to a function. Ok to ignore.
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Go" >}}
// If the sample can run into errors, write the error message to the provided
// io.Writer. Don't call log.Fatal or friends.
if err != nil {
    // TODO(developer): return or handle error as necessary
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "failed to initialize foo.Client: %v", err)
    return err
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Python" >}}
# Catch the most specific type of Exception, instead of a more general one.
try:
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    bucket.delete()
except google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound:
    # NOTE TO SAMPLE AUTHOR: Make sure to log errors rather than silentily ignore
    print(f"Resource '{name}' already deleted.")
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Node.js" >}}
// Unhandled exceptions will cause Node.js to crash. Log exception
// messages via console.error(), and handle any non-fatal exceptions.
try {
  // Do something
} catch (e) {
  // Log the error to stdout
  console.error('Error:', e.message);

  // Reraise any fatal exceptions
  if (/* exception is fatal */) {
    throw e
  }
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="C#" >}}
try
{
    // Do something
}
catch (ArgumentException e)
{
    //ArgumentException's are thrown when one of the arguments provided to a method is not valid.
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}

### Linting {#linting}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Our code snippets should adhere to a style used by the language communities.
We prefer to enforce style using standard linters that are popular in
the community.

{{< tabpane >}}

{{% tab header="Node.js" text=true %}}
Follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
and the [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html).

{{% tab header="PHP" text=true %}}
We follow the [PSR-1][psr-1] and [PSR-2][psr-2] community coding standards, with
one notable exception:

* The function names for samples are in `snake_case` rather than `camelCase`,
  in order to differentiate them from class methods.

### Portability {#portability}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Each of the major operating systems are well-represented among GCP users. To
provide a good user experience, our code snippets need to work on multiple
operating systems.

Our code snippets may be executed in multiple hosting environments, such as
[App Engine][gae], [Cloud Functions][gcf], [Cloud Run][run],
[Kubernetes Engine][gke], [Compute Engine][gce], Cloud Shell,
other cloud providers, and local machines.

Where possible, code snippets should work across environments and hosting
platforms. Code snippets should point out any differences between platforms via
code comments and use platform-agnostic libraries and code constructs.

Examples of portable practices include:

* Use the languageâ€™s standard path library to construct file paths
* Do not directly rely on POSIX system calls
* Handle case-sensitivity differences
* Avoid platform-specific APIs

[shell]: https://cloud.google.com/shell

## Testing {#testing}

### Coverage {#coverage}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Code snippets should have reasonable test coverage and all critical code paths
should have integration tests that test against the production service.

### Dedicated testing per snippet {#dedicated-testing-per-sample}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Each test case should cover a single snippet.

Multiple related snippets may be placed in a shared file with common setup and teardown steps.

## Language-specific practices {#language-specific}

{{< tabpane >}}
{{% tab header="Java" text=true %}}

### Easy run function {#run-function}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Any declared function arguments should include a no-arg, main method with
examples for how the user can initialize the method arguments and call the
entrypoint for the snippet. If the values for these variables need to be
replaced by the user, be explicit that they are example values only. Wherever
possible, provide a link to documentation that enumartes the options.

{{< highlight java >}}
// [START product_example]
import com.example.resource;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // TODO(developer): Replace these variables before running the sample.
    String projectId = "my-project-id";
    String filePath = "path/to/image.png";
    exampleSnippet(projectId, filePath);
}

// This is an example snippet for showing best practices.
public static void exampleSnippet(String projectId, String filePath) {
    // Snippet content ...
}
// [END product_example]

{{% tab header="C#" text=true %}}
// TODO

{{% tab header="PHP" text=true %}}

### Easy run function

**Applies to:** Snippets

Samples with function parameters should show how to prepare parameter values
and call the function. Do this from a `callSample()` function below the main
sample code. Do not include significant logic in the `callSample()` function,
and do not write tests for it.

Direct the developer to change the parameter values from the provided examples.

Where possible, provide a link to documentation that explains the options.

{{<highlight PHP>}}
// [START product_example]

/**
 * Example snippet showing the easy run function rule.
 *
 * @param string $projectId         Google Cloud Project
 * @param string $filePath          Path to file for processing
 */
function example_snippet(string $projectId, string $filePath): void
{
    // Snippet content ...
}

/**
 * TODO(developer): Replace sample parameters before running the code.
 */
function callSample(): void
{
    $projectId = 'your-project-id';
    $filePath = 'path/to/image.png';
    example_snippet($projectId, $region);
}
// [END product_example]
{{< / highlight >}}

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab header="Ruby" text=true %}}

### Named entrypoint

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Each Ruby sample should include an entrypoint method with the same name as the
sample file. (It may include helper methods if appropriate for readability.) The
entrypoint method should appear at the top level of the file rather than within
a class.

Example snippet with file name `read_a_file.rb`:

{{< highlight ruby >}}
##
# This is the entrypoint.
#
# @param file_path [String] Full path to input file (e.g. "/tmp/my-input.txt")
#
def read_a_file file_path:
  content = File.read file_path
  puts "Contents: #{content}"
end
{{< /highlight >}}

### Testing practices

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Each Ruby sample should have its own separate test file. Sample tests should
use the [Minitest][minitest] framework, and should be located in a file named
`<sample-name>_test.rb` under the `acceptance` directory.

Be aware that sample methods are defined at the top level and would thus be
added to the `Object` class if the file is loaded directly. In most cases,
tests should define a temporary class and load the sample in that class. Ruby
repositories may provide tools to help with this process, but it can also be
done with `eval`.

Example test: `acceptance/read_a_file.rb`:

{{< highlight ruby >}}
require "minitest/autorun"
require "tmpdir"

# Load the sample into this class so the method isn't defined on Object.
class ReadAFileSample
  sample_file = File.read "#{__dir__}/../read_a_file.rb"
  eval sample_file
end

describe "#read_a_file" do
  # Test the critical code paths
  it "reads a file" do
    Dir.mktmpdir do |dir|
      File.write "#{dir}/my-test.txt", "Hello, Ruby!"
      assert_output "Contents: Hello, Ruby!\n" do
        ReadAFileSample.new.read_a_file file_path: "#{dir}/my-test.txt"
      end
    end
  end
end

{{% tab header="Terraform" text=true %}}
#### Don't use `null_resource`

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Do not include CLI commands (such as gcloud or kubectl) inside
of your sample via the [`null_resource`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource) resource.

There are some products without Terraform support. Do not include
those products in Terraform samples.

#### No global variables

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Don't include global Terraform variables (`var.VARIABLE_NAME`).

{{% alert title="Explanation" %}}
Global variables become part of the API exposed via Terraform.
Therefore, global variables help enable users to use Terraform samples
not as snippets but as direct module references. 
By disallowing global variables, we disable this avenue of customization.
This reduces the risk of users developing code that is
accidentally dependent on our samples.

Instead of including global variables, hard code the resource names and
parameter values.

Local variables are allowed in Terraform samples
because local variables are an internal implementation and therefore aren't
part of the API exposed via Terraform. See [local variables](#locals).
{{% /alert %}}

#### Local variables {#locals}

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets

Use local variables to reuse a common string 3 or more times that is not
accessible as a resource reference.

See [No Global Variables](#no-global-variables) for further explanation.

#### Resource references

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Instead of duplicating know values, refer to already-defined resources.

For example, the `target` argument is referring to a
`google_compute_target_ssl_proxy` resource called `default` to get the
`id` attribute of that resource.

{{< highlight terraform >}}
resource "google_compute_global_forwarding_rule" "default" { 
  target = google_compute_target_ssl_proxy.default.id # Reference to already defined resource in the sample

  # Other resource arguments ...
}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Terraform Google Provider version

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

When your sample contains a new resource, add the required minimum
Terraform Google Provider version corresponding to which 
provider version introduced a resource. For example, `google_apigee_nat_address`
was added in version 4.37, so the minimum version is 4.37. To specify a minimum
version in a sample, include the provider requirements, as follows:

{{< highlight terraform >}}
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~= 4.37.0"
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

To determine when a resource was added, see the following pages:
   
* https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md
* https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

#### Provider argument

**Applies to:** âœ‚ï¸Ž Snippets, ðŸ§© Patterns

Add the provider argument if the resource is from provider google-beta.
   
{{< highlight terraform >}}
resource "google_<resource_name>" "default" {
  provider = google-beta

  # Other resource arguments ...
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Fields and resources that are only present in google-beta are clearly marked in
the provider documentation.
