## Applicable Samples

This style guide applies to new samples and to significant revisions of existing samples.
It does not require that previously authored samples keep up with guideline changes.

For "standalone" samples, the guidelines should be enforced strictly and
exceptions should be rare and with specific reason, up to the discretion of
the language reviewer(s).

For "application" samples, the guidelines should apply more loosely, following
the rules as possible without comprising the integrity of the application. 

## Review Comments

Feedback on samples PRs should reference the style guide wherever possible. 
Leave a short description of what's need to comply with the style guide, and
then link to the relevant guideline.
